                            Ending Story."</h2>
                        <p>Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. Old people don't need
                            companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients
                            they have that might be extracted for our personal use.</p>
                        <p><strong>Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his
                                dog.</strong> <em> Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog"
                                with "son.</em> " Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos.

                        <h3>Ahoy hoy?</h3>
                        <p>I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten
                            minutes! I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back
                            for ten minutes! I hope I didn't brain my damage.</p>
                        <h4>Ahoy hoy?</h4>
                        <p>I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a
                            *really* useful invention! Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help
                            tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!"</p>
                        <p>Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother
                            just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman! Oh, everything
                            looks bad if you remember it.</p>
                        <p>"Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place
                            within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion. Beer.
                            Now there's a temporary solution.</p>
                        <p>Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! Fire can be our friend;
                            whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. Aaah! Natural light! Get it
                            off me! Get it off me!</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am
                            not a crackpot. Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be
                            policing the entire city!</p>
                        <p>I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten
                            minutes! Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? I was saying "Boo-urns." Save me, Jeebus.
                            What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man?</p>
                        <p>We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy. Remember the time he ate my
                            goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart?
                            *Why did I have the bowl?*</p>
                        <p>How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church?
                            Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those
                            Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at
                            that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay
                            out of my booze. Ahoy hoy?</p>
                        <p>"Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place
                            within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion. A woman
                            is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice.</p>
                        <p>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. You don't like your
                            job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American
                            way. Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of
                            the babies and then the baby looked at me.</p>
                        <p>D'oh. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! I've done everything the Bible says — even
                            the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! Can't you people take the law into your own
                            hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city!</p>
                        <p>Me fail English? That's unpossible. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The
                            lesson is, never try. Duffman can't breathe! OH NO! Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! We started
                            out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</p>
